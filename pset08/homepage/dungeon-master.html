                A Dungeon Master is one of the players in a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game group.
                The other players each create a single character and use that character to
                interact with the imaginary world depicted in the game, but the DM plays a
                pivotal role that goes beyond that of the other players. In short, the Dungeon
                Master runs the game. You can get along without a fighter or a rogue or a
                cleric character, at least for a game session or two, but you can’t play a game
                of D&D without a DM.
            </h5>
            <br>
            <h5 id="padding">
                Because the D&D game is as wide open as the imaginations of the players, the
                presence of a DM to act as a moderator, story designer, and narrator is essential. The players interact
                with each other and the imaginary environment
                through the actions of their characters, and the DM describes each scene,
                directs the action, and plays the roles of the monsters, villains, and all the
                other people (the butcher, the baker, and the innkeeper, for example) that the
                characters meet on every adventure.
            </h5>
            <br>
            <h5 id="padding">
                As the DM, you aren’t competing against the players. You set up interesting,
                exciting, even challenging situations, and then use the game rules to fairly
                and impartially allow events to play out. You don’t know how things are going
                to turn out, and neither do the players.When you and the players get
                together to play out a compelling group story, everybody wins!

                <h5 id="padding">The D&D game uses a unique collection of dice, each with a different number of sides.
                    Dice add a
                    random element to the game, and in
                    fact, turn D&D into a game (as opposed to merely an improvisational

                    <h5 style="padding-left: 200px;  padding-right: 200px;">
                        You shouldn’t feel bad about sitting down to GM and not having a full grasp on every rule in the
                        book. If you’re confused about how something works in play, don’t panic. You can improvise what
                        happens in the moment and check on the rule later, or even pause the game briefly to give your
                        players a break whilst you read the rulebook. Whatever you need, just do it. No-one is going to
                        be upset that you don’t have an encyclopedic knowledge of how the game works on day one. (If
                        they do, they probably suck - maybe don’t play with them.)

                        Here’s a subtip for free as well: your players can read the rulebook as well. RPGs aren’t a
                        30-minute board game you play once and move on from; you can spend your entire lives playing
                        some campaigns. The more of your group that read and understand the rules, the easier it’s going
                        to be to have a good time and crack on with the roleplay.

                    <h5 style="padding-left: 200px;  padding-right: 200px;">
                        One of the biggest mistakes a lot of new GMs make is spending an entire week obsessively
                        planning out a whole city’s worth of NPCs and encounters and lore and maps and- oh god, the
                        paper, there is so much paper everywhere.
                    </h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 200px;  padding-right: 200px;">
                        Take a breath. There’s something you need to understand about roleplaying: nothing ever goes to
                        plan. So much so that the one-in-a-million time where everything does go exactly as you expected
                        it to, you’ll be so taken aback that you’ll forget what your plan even was.
                    </h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 200px;  padding-right: 200px;">
                        The fact of the matter is your players will decide what actually happens in each session. The
                        job of a GM isn’t to control the story but to guide it and react to it. You facilitate the
                        adventure that your players are having. When you overplan your sessions you build these
                        dependencies into the narrative that your players need to interact with to make it work. This
                        can lead to a lot of GM frustration. “Argh, why aren’t they talking to this character? I spent a
                        whole hour practising their voice lines and writing a complicated backstory!”
                    </h5>

                    <div style="margin-top: 50px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>

                    <h5 style="padding-left: 200px;  padding-right: 200px;">
                        This is a simple one. You as the GM of the game do not have to be completely in charge of
                        everything that happens in the world. RPGs are, for the most part, designed to be played as a
                        group. And sometimes the rest of that group should be given the reins from time to time.
                    </h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 200px;  padding-right: 200px;">
                        One of your strongest tools in the RPG toolbox is literally just asking your players questions.
                        What do you find? How do they respond? What does it feel like? They can be little flourishes of
                        player control or massive plot-defining moments handed over with love and trust to the player
                        who it means the most to.
                    </h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 200px;  padding-right: 200px;">
                        This isn’t unprecedented, by the way. You’ll often see things like this in modern RPGs. In
                        Blades in the Dark, your players create the quests and some of the NPCs - they invent the
                        magical items, choose their adversaries and define the stakes at hand. It’s a pretty common
                        thing for D&D dungeon masters to ask the player to describe what happens when they critically
                        hit an enemy, giving them a cool flourish after a big chunk of damage.
                    </h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 200px;  padding-right: 200px;">
                        You don’t have to cordon off specific areas where the players are allowed to take control - give
                        them the power whenever it seems interesting or appropriate. You’ll be surprised by how much it
                        can elevate the story you’re all telling together and it’s a great way of getting your players
                        more invested as they’ll feel more agency over the direction of the game.

                    <h5 style="padding-left: 200px;  padding-right: 200px;">
                        This is something often assumed to be common knowledge but it bears repeating. Roleplaying isn’t
                        a competitive experience. Stories only build themselves when you work together, and that
                        includes the GM. If you’re building your experiences in an effort to ‘beat’ the player you’re
                        more likely to just frustrate or annoy them.

                        If players are asking genuine questions that are going to help them have a good time and you’re
                        being secretive with them to stop them getting the upper hand, or if you’re unflinching in your
                        sticking to the rules to the detriment of your group, you’re not gonna be telling a good story.

                        There are RPGs that are built like that, absolutely. Those can be fun to play, and some players
                        do want a tough-as-nails challenge. For the most part, though, people are playing RPGs so that
                        they can tell cool or interesting stories with their friends. If you’re going out of your way to
                        disrupt that in an effort to ‘win’, that just sucks.

                        These things change as well - something that might not have been an issue for you in the last
                        session could now be a hugely traumatic thing to experience in play and your guidelines around
                        those topics will need to be clearly translated and fluid.
