    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of
        your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You
        choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the
        personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your
        representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons & Dragons world.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you
        want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you
        come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Throughout this section, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character,
        whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or
        a piece of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what
        information you need and how you use it during the game.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 200px;  font-weight: bold;">1. Choose a Race</h3>
    <div style="width: 1500px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most
        common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces, such as
        mountain dwarf or wood elf. The Races section provides more information about these races.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general
        appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular
        racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more
        skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain
        classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and
        high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling paladins and
        mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases
        and remember to apply them later.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your
        base speed as well.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 200px;  font-weight: bold;">2. Choose a Class</h3>
    <div style="width: 1500px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he
        or
        she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters,
        or
        engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in the Classes section.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class
        features — capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes.
        You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your
        proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to
        telling a convincing lie.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 200px;  font-weight: bold;">3. Determine Ability Scores</h3>
    <div style="width: 1500px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: <b>Strength</b>,
        <b>Dexterity</b>,
        <b>Constitution</b>, <b>Intelligence</b>, <b>Wisdom</b>, and <b>Charisma</b>. Each ability has a score, which is
        a number you record on your
        character sheet.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what
        races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        You generate your character’s six <b>ability scores</b> randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of
        the
        highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you
        want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following
        scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to
        Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your
        ability scores as a result of your race choice.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        After assigning your ability scores, determine your <b>ability modifiers</b> using the Ability Scores and
        Modifiers
        table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and
        then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 200px;  font-weight: bold;">3.1-Rolling Ability Scores:</h4>
    <div style="width: 1500px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        There are six ability boxes below. In order to create a character, you can roll six abilities in order. Each one
        will give
        you an ability score by rolling randomly four six-sided dice. The highest three will be recorded.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <div>
        <div id="block_container">
            <div id="die1" class="dice" style="margin-left: 200px;">0</div>

    </div>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 200px;  font-weight: bold;">3.2-Ability Score Point Cost:</h4>
    <div style="width: 1500px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method
        described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point
        Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you
        can end up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones
        (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any
        set of numbers between those extremes.

    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your
        character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves
        in general terms.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Using the information in the Personality and Background section, you can flesh out your character’s physical
        appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral compass that guides his or her
        decisions) and ideals. The Personality and Background section also helps you identify the things your character
        holds most dear, called bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine him or her.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Your character’s background describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the
        character’s place in the D&D world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in the
        Personality and Background section, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more
        precise fit for your character concept.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it
        might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information,
        along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 200px;  font-weight: bold;">Your Character's Abilities</h4>
    <div style="width: 1500px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and
        personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very
        smart character with low Strength.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low
        Strength might be scrawny or plump.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either
        gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with
        low Constitution might be sickly or frail.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low
        Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character
        with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating
        presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 200px;  font-weight: bold;">5-Choose Equipment</h3>
    <div style="width: 1500px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Your class and background determine your character’s starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and other
        adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in the Equipment
        section.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment.
        You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown in the Equipment section. Extensive
        lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that section. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no
        cost.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight
        (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. "Using Ability Scores" has more information on carrying
        capacity.
    </h5>
    <br>

        Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your
        character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves
        in general terms.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 200px;  font-weight: bold;">Armor Class</h4>
    <div style="width: 1500px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute
        to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters
        wear armor or carry shields, however.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character
        wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in the Equipment section. Record your
        AC on your character sheet.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor
        and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield
        if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in the Equipment section.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that
        give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 200px;  font-weight: bold;">Weapons</h4>
    <div style="width: 1500px;" class="horizontal-line-basic"></div>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the
        damage you deal when you hit.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are
        proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <div style="padding-left: 250px; padding-right: 200px;">
            <li>
                <h5 style="margin-right: 200px;">
                    For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon
                    that
                    has
                    the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.
                </h5>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h5 style="margin-right: 200px;">
                    For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee
                    weapon
                    that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.
                </h5>

    <h5 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        Most D&D characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers working
        together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many
        perils in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your
        characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.
